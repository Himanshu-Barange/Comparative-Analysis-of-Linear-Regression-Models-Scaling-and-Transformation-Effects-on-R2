## Brief Description
This project investigates the impact of scaling and transformation techniques on the performance of linear regression models. Using the well-known tips dataset, various scenarios are explored, including scaling y on log scale, x on log scale, both on log scale, and both on z-scale. Additionally, a multiple regression model is created, including the 'size' variable to analyze the impact of additional predictors and to demonstrate the use of standard scaling in multiple regression models. The coefficient of determination (RÂ²) is compared across these different setups to analyze how scaling and transformation affect model performance.
