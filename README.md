This project investigates the impact of scaling and transformation techniques on the performance of linear regression models. Using the well-known tips dataset, various scenarios are explored, including scaling y on log scale, x on log scale, both on log scale, and both on z-scale. The coefficient of determination (RÂ²) is compared across these different setups to analyze how scaling and transformation affect model performance.
